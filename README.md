This traffic simulator runs on auto-pilot to investigate if using sensor-actuated traffic lights can improve pass-rate and lower wait times in traffic.

It runs 200 automated simulations, then displays a report of findings in your browser. The tab running the simulation would need to remain active during the simulation.

Visit https://traffic-simulator.herokuapp.com/traffic/test/controller/0  to give the simulator a spin.
